# Disaster Relief-Titanic

## Requirements: Python 2.7, Anaconda with following python libraries installed

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. sklearn
4. matplotlib
5. Seaborn

## Model used: 
- Logistic Regression


<b>Problem Statement:</b> My data is from the 1912 titanic disaster. I want to find out if I can use certain characteristics of each passenger on the boat to determine survival. On a larger scale. I want to find out if I can develop a model that can be beneficial for emergency management in light of a disaster.  More specifically, can I use a passsengers boarding pass information to determine if that they survived a plane crash?
